# Heap Sort Unit Testing â€“ CSE 565 Assignment

This repository is part of the CSE 565: Software Verification and Validation course. It focuses on implementing the Heap Sort algorithm in Python and performing unit-level testing. The testing process was enhanced using generative AI (ChatGPT) for initial test case generation, followed by manual improvements for broader coverage.

# Objectives

- Implement the Heap Sort algorithm in Python.
- Generate and refine unit test cases using ChatGPT.
- Execute and validate tests using Python's unittest framework.
- Improve coverage by adding edge case scenarios.
- Reflect on the role and effectiveness of AI tools in software testing.
- Files Overview

# Summary of Work
**Heap Sort Implementation:** Clean implementation in heap_sort.py.
**Testing:** Used unittest to validate correctness.
**AI Integration:** ChatGPT was used to scaffold initial test cases.
**Test Enhancement:** Added edge cases such as:
Empty list
Negative numbers
Duplicate values
Already sorted input
**Effectiveness Evaluation:** AI proved helpful for fast scaffolding, though manual refinement was essential for comprehensive coverage.
