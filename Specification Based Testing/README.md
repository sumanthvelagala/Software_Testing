# Specification-Based Testing â€“ CSE 565 Assignment

This repository includes test cases and documentation for the specification-based testing assignment in CSE 565: Software Verification and Validation.

# Overview

The goal of this assignment was to test a Java application (CSE565P1.jar) using black-box testing techniques:

- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Cause-and-Effect Testing
Developed both manual and automated test cases, identified defects, and documented the findings.

# File Structure

File	Description
CSE565P1.jar	- Java application under test
project1GUI.jar	- GUI version of the same application
Project1Script	- Bash script to run test cases automatically
Specification Based Testing_TestCaseSpreadsheet.xlsx	- Test cases, description of defects found


# Summary

- Tested input constraints, discount logic, and validation rules.
- Invalid inputs (e.g., underage users, malformed names, out-of-range ratings) were flagged correctly.
- The spreadsheet includes at 14 defects, with traceability to both requirements, test cases along with their description.
